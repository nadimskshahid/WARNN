Authors: Tanujit Chakraborty, Sk Shahid Nadim, Indrajit Ghosh and Maher Maalouf. 

This paper proposes a new "Wavelet autoregressive neural network" for dengue epidemic forecasting. 
The implementation code of two proposed models are available at "Proposed_Model.R" file along with several statistical tests that have been implemented in the paper. 
The functions are available as "warnn.R" and "warnnx.R" which will be required to run the proposed models in R. 
Two datasets, namely Sanjuan_data_weekly.csv and Iquitos_data_weekly.csv are made available for practical implementation and reproducibility of the results prodcued in the paper. 
Parameter values are reported in the paper which can be directely derived after implementation of the codes given in this repository.
